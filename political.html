Noor then the a student (who just gave matriculation), joined the East Pakistan Student’s Union which was a left sided organization. Later he became the chairman of the Nilfamari Mohokuma Shomeetee. In 1966 he got admitted to Dhaka University to study law still a member of the Student’s Union. Later he became the cultural secretary of the central committee. He also was the chairman of the "Shongskriti Shongshod" , a very large cultural organization of Dhaka University. Noor stayed in the Iqbal Hall (now Johurul Huq hall) which was the centre of student politics during that period. At that time Noor came in contact with the versatile student leaders of that time. Though the followers of different political belief they worked together against the dictatorship of West Pakistan government. At the eve of Bangladesh Liberation War Noor left Dhaka and came back to Nilfamary when he received an order from his political party on March 8, 1971. There he helped the then East Pakistan Rifles (now Bangladesh Rifles). He crossed the border during the War of Liberation on April 8. Asaduzzaman Noor was a freedom fighter under the Sector-6 and helped to organize the war and took training. He also helped to recruit freedom fighters during the nine month war period. But later in the independent Bangladesh his distance with active politics grew larger. In 1990 when the Revolution against autocrat Ershad took place, Noor again came to join the movement. With this event Noor made a come back to politics again. In that time Noor came in touch with Sheikh Hasina, the leader of one of the main political team Awami League. In ’96 Hasina asked him to take part in the election for Awami League. Because of not being mentally prepared Noor turned that down and worked as a cultural activist for the Party.
